================================================================================

🛡️ ESSENTIAL RISK RULES:
1. Never risk more than 2% of total portfolio on any single trade
2. Use proper position sizing based on stop loss distance

4. Take partial profits at predetermined levels

**Fundamental Adjustment**: Consider reducing position size by 25-50% 
for stocks with Fundamental Score < 3.0
