📚 UNDERSTANDING BULLISH vs BEARISH SIGNALS:
================================================================================
🟢 BULLISH SIGNAL EXPLANATION:
A bullish signal suggests potential upward price movement when ALL criteria align:

✅ Supertrend Bullish: Price is above the Supertrend line
   → Indicates the trend has shifted upward
   → Supertrend acts as dynamic support

✅ Guppy EMAs Bullish: Short EMAs (3,5,8,10,12,15) above Long EMAs (30,35,40,45,50,60)
   → Short-term momentum is stronger than long-term
   → Institutional and retail traders both buying

✅ Squeeze Momentum: Bollinger Bands inside Keltner Channels
   → Low volatility period that often precedes big moves
   → Compression leads to expansion

✅ Volume Spike: Current volume > 1.5x average volume
   → Increased interest and conviction
   → More likely to sustain the move

✅ RSI Filter: RSI between 30-70
   → Not overbought (avoiding false breakouts)
