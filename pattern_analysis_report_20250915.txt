NOTE ON PATTERN CLASSIFICATION:
Bullish or bearish patterns in this report are determined using technical analysis algorithms that scan for price and volume patterns historically associated with upward (bullish) or downward (bearish) trends.
These may include candlestick formations, breakouts, moving average crossovers, and other quantitative signals.
A bullish pattern suggests a potential upward move; a bearish pattern suggests a potential downward move.
However, these signals are probabilistic, not guarantees. Always use additional analysis and risk management.
