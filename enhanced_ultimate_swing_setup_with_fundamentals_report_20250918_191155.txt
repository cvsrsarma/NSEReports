⚠️ RISK MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES ⚠️
================================================================================

🛡️ ESSENTIAL RISK RULES:
1. Never risk more than 2% of total portfolio on any single trade
2. Use proper position sizing based on stop loss distance
3. Always use stop losses - no exceptions
4. Take partial profits at predetermined levels

💰 POSITION SIZING FORMULA:
Position Size = (Account Risk %) / (Stop Loss Distance %)

Position Size = (₹2,000) / (5%) = ₹40,000 worth of shares

**Fundamental Adjustment**: Consider reducing position size by 25-50% 
for stocks with Fundamental Score < 3.0
